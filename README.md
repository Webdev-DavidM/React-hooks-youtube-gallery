This is a react project so to run this file, download the code, navigate to the main folder and press npm start.

The  is my first small project created with react hooks. It also introduced me to using the youtube api to fetch data and using the npm package react-youtube. It was also the first time I have created a modal in react with video content so some good experience gained.
